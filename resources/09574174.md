# Process mining techniques and applications â€“ A systematic mapping study

### Abstract 
Process mining is a growing and promising study area focused on understanding processes and to help capture the more significant findings during real execution rather than, those methods that, only observed idealized process model. The objective of this article is to map the active research topics of process mining and their main publishers by country, periodicals, and conferences. We also extract the reported application studies and classify these by exploration domains or industry segments that are taking advantage of this technique. The applied research method was systematic mapping, which began with 3713 articles. After applying the exclusion criteria, 1278 articles were selected for review. In this article, an overview regarding process mining is presented, the main research topics are identified, followed by identification of the most applied process mining algorithms, and finally application domains among different business segments are reported on. It is possible to observe that the most active research topics are associated with the process discovery algorithms, followed by conformance checking, and architecture and tools improvements. In application domains, the segments with major case studies are healthcare followed by information and communication technology, manufacturing, education, finance, and logistics.
