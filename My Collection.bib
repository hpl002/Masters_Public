abstract = {Process mining techniques use event data to show what people, machines, and organizations are really doing. Process mining provides novel insights that can be used to identify and address performance and compliance problems. In recent years, the adoption of process mining in practice increased rapidly. It is interesting to see how ideas first developed in open-source tools like ProM, get transferred to the dozens of available commercial process mining tools. However, these tools still resort to producing Directly-Follows Graphs (DFGs) based on event data rather than using more sophisticated notations also able to capture concurrency. Moreover, to tackle complexity, DFGs are seamlessly simplified by removing nodes and edges based on frequency thresholds. Process-mining practitioners tend to use such simplified DFGs actively. Despite their simplicity, these DFGs may be misleading and users need to know how these process models are generated before interpreting them. In this paper, we discuss the pitfalls of using simple DFGs generated by commercial tools. Practitioners conducting a process-mining project need to understand the risks associated with the (incorrect) use of DFGs and frequency-based simplification. Therefore, we put these risks in the spotlight.},

abstract = {Simulation is widely used as a tool for analyzing business processes but is mostly focused on examining rather abstract steady-state situations. Such analyses are helpful for the initial design of a business process but are less suitable for operational decision making and continuous improvement. Here we describe a simulation system for operational decision support in the context of workflow management. To do this we exploit not only the workflow's design, but also logged data describing the system's observed historic behavior, and information extracted about the current state of the workflow. Making use of actual data capturing the current state and historic information allows our simulations to accurately predict potential near-future behaviors for different scenarios. The approach is supported by a practical toolset which combines and extends the workflow management system YAWL and the process mining framework ProM.},

abstract = {When looking for the best model, simulation is often used for "what-if" analysis. The properties of a modelled process are explored by repeatedly executing the model. Based on the outcomes, parts of the model may be manually modified to improve the process. This is iteratively done to obtain the model best suited to a user's requirements. In most cases, this is a labour-intensive and time-consuming task. To improve on the state of the art, we propose a framework where the user defines a space of possible process models with the use of a configurable process model. A configurable process model is a compact representation of a family of process models, i.e., a set of process models related to each other. Within the framework, different tools can be used to automatically compute characteristics of a model. We show that, when used on data from multiple real-life models, our framework can find better models in an automated way.},

The events found in these domains typically refer to activities executed by resources at particular times and for particular cases. Process mining provides the means to discover the real processes, to detect deviations from normative processes, and to analyze bottlenecks and waste from such events. However, process mining tends to be backward-looking. Fortunately, simulation can be used to explore different design alternatives and to anticipate future performance problems. This keynote paper discusses the link between both types of analysis and elaborates on the challenges process discovery techniques are facing. Quality notions such as recall, precision, and generalization are discussed. Rather than introducing a specific process discovery or conformance checking algorithm, the paper provides a comprehensive set of conformance propositions. These conformance propositions serve two purposes: (1) introducing the essence of process mining by discussing the relation between event logs and process models, and (2) discussing possible requirements for the quantification of quality notions related to recall, precision, and generalization.},

abstract = {Process mining combines model-based process analysis with data-driven analysis techniques. The role of process mining is to extract knowledge and gain insights from event logs. Most existing techniques focus on process discovery (the automated extraction of process models) and conformance checking (aligning observed and modeled behavior). Relatively little research has been performed on the analysis of business process performance. Cooperative business processes often exhibit a high degree of variability and depend on many factors. Finding root causes for inefficiencies such as delays and long waiting times in such flexible processes remains an interesting challenge. This paper introduces a novel approach to analyze key process performance indicators by considering the process context. A generic context-aware analysis framework is presented that analyzes performance characteristics from multiple perspectives. A statistical approach is then utilized to evaluate and find significant differences in the results. Insights obtained can be used for finding high-impact points for optimization, prediction, and monitoring. The practical relevance of the approach is shown in a case study using real-life data.},

abstract = {Process mining is the research domain that is dedicated to the a posteriori analysis of business process executions. The techniques developed within this research area are specifically designed to provide profound insight by exploiting the untapped reservoir of knowledge that resides within event logs of information systems. Process discovery is one specific subdomain of process mining that entails the discovery of control-flow models from such event logs. Assessing the quality of discovered process models is an essential element, both for conducting process mining research as well as for the use of process mining in practice. In this paper, a multi-dimensional quality assessment is presented in order to comprehensively evaluate process discovery techniques. In contrast to previous studies, the major contribution of this paper is the use of eight real-life event logs. For instance, we show that evaluation based on real-life event logs significantly differs from the traditional approach to assess process discovery techniques using artificial event logs. In addition, we provide an extensive overview of available process discovery techniques and we describe how discovered process models can be assessed regarding both accuracy and comprehensibility. The results of our study indicate that the HeuristicsMiner algorithm is especially suited in a real-life setting. However, it is also shown that, particularly for highly complex event logs, knowledge discovery from such data sets can become a major problem for traditional process discovery techniques. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {In order to improve the performance of business processes often Information Technologies (ITs) are introduced. However, business processes are known to be complex and distributed among multiple business entities. As a result, the impact of new IT on an entire business process is typically hard to assess as quantitative methods for evaluation are missing. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a process-oriented methodology for evaluating the impact of IT on a business process ahead of its implementation. In our method, process mining and discrete event simulation are key ingredients. Based on automatically stored data, process mining allows for obtaining detailed knowledge on a business process, e.g., it can be discovered how a business process is actually executed. Using discrete event simulation, a model can be built which accurately mimicks the discovered process and which can subsequently be used for exploring and evaluating various redesign of the same process. Our method is evaluated by means of a detailed case study. For a complex dental process, it turns out that the introduction of new digital technologies is largely beneficial for patients and dental lab owners, whereas for dentists there is hardly any benefit. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

The model usually needs to be repaired to accurately describe the business process realized by the information system. The existing methods for repairing process models cannot enhance efficiently some model consistency metrics, such as the fitness, precision, and simplicity. Thus, a new model repair approach is proposed based on an extended Petri net named logic Petri net in this paper. It can improve the model's fitness and precision comparing with the existing work. First, it builds process models via logic Petri nets. Next, approaches are proposed to repair the process models containing a causal relation and a concurrent relation, respectively. Specifically, a precursor set and a successor set of activities are defined and the relation of the elements in each of them is determined. Finally, we give some cases related to a thoracic surgery process in a hospital and conduct experiments to illustrate the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

abstract = {Contemporary workflow management systems are driven by explicit process models, i.e., a completely specified workflow design is required in order to enact a given workflow process. Creating a workflow design is a complicated time-consuming process and, typically, there are discrepancies between the actual workflow processes and the processes as perceived by the management. Therefore, we have developed techniques for discovering workflow models. The starting point for such techniques is a so-called "workflow log" containing information about the workflow process as it is actually being executed. We present a new algorithm to extract a process model from such a log and represent it in terms of a Petri net. However, we will also demonstrate that it is not possible to discover arbitrary workflow processes. In this paper, we explore a class of workflow processes that can be discovered. We show that the $\alpha$-algorithm can successfully mine any workflow represented by a so-called SWF-net.},

abstract = {Abstract This book discusses how model-based approaches can improve the daily practice of software professionals. This is known as Model-Driven Software Engineering (MDSE) or, simply, Model-Driven Engineering (MDE). MDSE practices have proved to increase efficiency and effectiveness in software development, as demonstrated by various quantitative and qualitative studies. MDSE adoption in the software industry is foreseen to grow exponentially in the near future, e.g., due to the convergence of software development and business analysis. The aim of this book is to provide you with an agile and flexible tool to introduce you to the MDSE world, thus allowing you to quickly understand its basic principles and techniques and to choose the right set of MDSE instruments for your needs so that you can start to benefit from MDSE right away. The book is organized into two main parts. The first part discusses the foundations of MDSE in terms of basic concepts (i.e., models and transformations), driving principles, application scenarios and current standards, like the well-known MDA initiative proposed by OMG (Object Management Group) as well as the practices on how to integrate MDSE in existing development processes. The second part deals with the technical aspects of MDSE, spanning from the basics on when and how to build a domain-specific modeling language, to the description of Model-to-Text and Model-to-Model transformations, and the tools that support the management of MDSE projects. The book is targeted to a diverse set of readers, spanning: professionals, CTOs, CIOs, and team managers that need to have a bird's eye vision on the matter, so as to take the appropriate decisions when it comes to choosing the best development techniques for their company or team; software analysts, developers, or designers that expect to use MDSE for improving everyday work productivity, either by applying the basic modeling techniques and notations or by defining new domain-specific modeling languages and applying end-to-end MDSE practices in the software factory; and academic teachers and students to address undergrad and postgrad courses on MDSE. In addition to the contents of the book, more resources are provided on the book's website, including the examples presented in the book.

abstract = {Abstract Long-haul travel does not constitute an obstacle for tourists to travel and is fast gaining the attention of tourists in new and unique experiences. This study was conducted to identify the long-haul travel motivation by international tourists to Penang. A total of 400 respondents participated in this survey, conducted around the tourist attractions in Penang, using cluster random sampling. However, only 370 questionnaires were only used for this research. Data were analysed using SPSS software 22 version. The findings, ‘knowledge and novelty seeking' were the main push factors that drove long-haul travel by international tourists to Penang. Meanwhile, the main pull factor that attracts long- haul travel by international tourists to Penang was its ‘culture and history'. Additionally, there were partly direct and significant relationships between socio-demographic, trip characteristics and travel motivation (push factors and pull factors). Overall, this study identified the long-haul travel motivations by international tourists to Penang based on socio-demographic, trip characteristics and travel motivation and has indirectly helped in understanding the long-haul travel market particularly for Penang and Southeast Asia. This research also suggested for an effective marketing and promotion strategy in pro- viding useful information that is the key to attract international tourists to travel long distances.

Several health care administrators have used discrete- event simulation as an effective tool for allocating scarce resources to improve patient flow, while minimising health care delivery costs and increasing patient satisfaction. The rapid growth in simulation software technology has created numerous new application opportunities, including more sophisticated implementations, as well as combining optimisation and simulation for complex integrated facilities. This paper surveys the application of discrete-event simulation modeling to health care clinics and systems of clinics (for example, hospitals, outpatient clinics, emergency departments, and pharmacies).

Changing a part of the system to support the business process implies changing the entire system, which leads to complex redesign activities. In this paper, a bottom-up process mining and simulation-based methodology is proposed to be employed in redesign activities. The methodology starts with identifying relevant performance issues, which are used as basis for redesign. A process model is "mined" and simulated as a representation of the existing situation, followed by the simulation of the redesigned process model as prediction of the future scenario. Finally, the performance criteria of the current business process model and the redesigned business process model are compared such that the potential performance gains of the redesign can be predicted. We illustrate the methodology with three case studies from three different domains: gas industry, government institution and agriculture.},

abstract = {Process discovery, as the most crucial learning task in the process mining, builds some highly complex process models such as 'spaghetti-like' from event logs contained large amounts of data. To enhance the process discovery method for all of flexible environments, many researchers tried to exploit trace clustering approaches to split the logs into several homogeneous sub-logs, which are used to generate the corresponding sub-process model, respectively. However, their works are based on the assumption that the event logs are complete without missing any data values. On the contrary, the data in an event log may be lost due to some reasons such as system failure and human error. In this paper, we propose a method to deal with incomplete logs so as to discover the process model. First, we split up the event logs based on trace clustering. Then, the missing traces are assigned to the most similar clustering results, respectively. After that, with supplementing the missing data in the trace, a corresponding sub-process model is mined using the proposed method. At last, some experimental results on three real-life complex event logs demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our method.},

These so-called event logs (also called audit trails, or transaction logs) are the starting point for various discovery and analysis techniques that help to gain insight into certain characteristics of the process. In this paper we use a combination of process mining techniques to discover multiple perspectives (namely, the control-flow, data, performance, and resource perspective) of the process from historic data, and we integrate them into a comprehensive simulation model. This simulation model is represented as a colored Petri net (CPN) and can be used to analyze the process, e.g., evaluate the performance of different alternative designs. The discovery of simulation models is explained using a running example. Moreover, the approach has been applied in two case studies; the workflows in two different municipalities in the Netherlands have been analyzed using a combination of process mining and simulation. Furthermore, the quality of the CPN models generated for the running example and the two case studies has been evaluated by comparing the original logs with the logs of the generated models. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Analysis of these execution logs may reveal important knowledge that can help organizations to improve the quality of their services. Starting from a process model, which can be discovered by conventional process mining algorithms, we analyze how data attributes influence the choices made in the process based on past process executions using decision mining, also referred to as decision point analysis. In this paper we describe how the resulting model (including the discovered data dependencies) can be represented as a Colored Petri Net (CPN), and how further perspectives, such as the performance and organizational perspective, can be incorporated. We also present a CPN Tools Export plug-in implemented within the ProM framework. Using this plug-in, simulation models in ProM obtained via a combination of various process mining techniques can be exported to CPN Tools. We believe that the combination of automatic discovery of process models using ProM and the simulation capabilities of CPN Tools offers an innovative way to improve business processes. The discovered process model describes reality better than most hand-crafted simulation models.

abstract = {Computer simulation attempts to "mimic" real-life or hypothetical behavior on a computer to see how processes or systems can be improved and to predict their performance under different circumstances. Simulation has been successfully applied in many disciplines and is considered to be a relevant and highly applicable tool in Business Process Management (BPM). Unfortunately, in reality the use of simulation is limited. Few organizations actively use simulation. Even organizations that purchase simulation software (stand-alone or embedded in some BPM suite), typically fail to use it continuously over an extended period. This keynote paper highlights some of the problems causing the limited adoption of simulation. For example, simulation models tend to oversimplify the modeling of people working part-time on a process. Also simulation studies typically focus on the steady-state behavior of business processes while managers are more interested in short-term results (a "fast forward button" into the future) for operational decision making. This paper will point out innovative simulation approaches leveraging on recent breakthroughs in process mining. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer-Verlag.},
annote = {For simulating business processes at least three
perspectives need to be modeled: (a) control-flow, (b) data/rules, and (c) re-source/organization.

The control-flow perspective is concerned with the ordering of activities and uses design artifacts such as sequences, AND/XOR-splits/joins, loops, etc. [1].

The data/rules perspective models decisions made within the process and the role that data plays in these decisions.

The resource/organization perspective is concerned with the allocation of activities to resources, availability and speed of resources, and organizational boundaries [21].

In all of this time (e.g., the duration of an activity) and prob- abilities (e.g., the likelihood of following a particular path) play an important role. By answering “what-if” questions, managers and users get more insight into the effects of particular decisions.

There are also several additional and more fundamental problems as to why simulation has not been used effectively to analyze business processes.

1. Simulation models tend to over-simplify
The behavior of resources is often modeled in a rather naive manner.

2. Artifacts available are not used as input
for simulation.

3. The focus of simulation is mainly on “design” while managers would also like to use simulation for “operational decision making” (solving the concrete problem at hand rather than some abstract future problem).

Fortunately, short-term simu- lation [16, 20, 24] can provide answers for questions related to “here and now”.

Simulation can be used to predict the performance under various circumstances, e.g., different business process re-engineering alternatives can be compared with the current situation.

The value of such predictions stands or falls with the qual-ity of the simulation model.


Basically, there are three problems:
(a) the process is modeled incorrectly, 
(b) not enough data was collected to be
able to parameterize the model, and 
(c) the language does not allow for the
modeling of more subtle behaviors.


Probably the biggest problem of current business simulation approaches is
that human resources are modeled in a very naive manner.


In most
simulation tools it is impossible to model that a resource is only available 20
percent of the time. Hence, one needs to assume that the manager is there all
the time and has a very low utilization.


people
work at different speeds based on their workload, i.e., it is not just the distribu-tion of attention over various processes, but also their absolute working speed
that determines their capacity for a particular process.

People tend to work part-time and in batches


People need to continuously choose between work-items and
set priorities. Although important, this is typically not captured by simulation
models.


Process may change depending on context. Another problem is that most simulation tools assume a stable process and organization and that neither of them change over time. 

simulation models tend not to capture cer- tain aspects or stick to an idealized variant of the real process.

This can be partly addressed by better modeling techniques. However, to adequately set these parameters and to make sure that processes are modeled accurately, we propose to also exploit the information available in event logs.


The current data (“pre mortem”) can be used to construct a well defined starting
point for simulation. This is of particular importance for predictions in the near
future.


de jure models are
normative models that describe a desired or required way of working while de
facto models aim to describe the actual reality with all of its intricacies (policy
violations, inefficiencies, fraud, etc.).


Therefore, the goal is
to shift more to “de facto models for simulation”; this will save time and increase
quality.},
